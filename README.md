# Data Structures

A collection of my solutions to problems from my Data Structures course at Oregon State University.
The course included design/analysis of algorithms and data structures; Dynamic arrays, Linked lists, Stacks, Bags, Queues, Deques, Trees, BSTs, ADLs, Heaps, Graphs, and Hash tables. This course taught me how to implement these Data Structures and my problem-solving abilities increased greatly by the end.
